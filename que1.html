    You and your 4 other teammates are stranded in the desert during a treasure hunt. One of them is injured and he can hardly walk.
    <br>
   You have food enough for 4 people to last a day, but defenitely not for 5. One of them suggests that you should abandon the injured teammate because he won't last long.
   What do you do?
